  !!! DISCLAIMER: THIS STORY IS NOT VERIFIED AND IS PURELY FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES !!!

  On the evening of {{arrest-date}}, {{person1}}, a {{person1:age}}-year-old student from {{hometown}}, joined a peaceful vigil in {{main-square}}.

  The gathering was one of many spontaneous demonstrations that erupted across Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody on {{mahsa-death}}{{source:mahsa-death-source}}. {{person1}} held a candle and chanted "{{chant}}" with approximately {{protesters}} others.

  At {{raid-time}}, security forces arrived and began making arrests. {{person1}} was among {{arrested}} people detained that night and taken to {{detention-center}}.

  For {{detention-days}} days, {{person1}}'s family had no information about their whereabouts. Phone calls to authorities went unanswered. On day {{first-contact-day}}, they finally received a brief call confirming {{person1}} was alive but providing no other details.

  {{person1}}'s family scraped together {{bail-amount}} for bail. This amount represented approximately {{months-salary}} months of {{parent}}'s salary as a {{parent-job}}.

  After {{detention-days}} days in custody, {{person1}} was released with strict conditions: no social media, no attending gatherings, and regular check-ins with authorities. The charges remain pending.

  "I just wanted to light a candle for Mahsa," {{person1}} said. "I never imagined this would happen."
