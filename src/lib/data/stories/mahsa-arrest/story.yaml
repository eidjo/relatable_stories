  !!! DISCLAIMER: THIS STORY IS NOT VERIFIED AND IS PURELY FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES !!!

  On the evening of {{date:arrest-date}}, {{name:person1}}, a {{number:age}}-year-old student from {{place:hometown}}, joined a peaceful vigil in {{place:main-square}}.

  The gathering was one of many spontaneous demonstrations that erupted across Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody on {{date:mahsa-death}}{{source:mahsa-death-source}}. {{name:person1}} held a candle and chanted "{{event:chant}}" with approximately {{number:protesters}} others.

  At {{time:raid-time}}, security forces arrived and began making arrests. {{name:person1}} was among {{number:arrested}} people detained that night and taken to {{place:detention-center}}.

  For {{number:detention-days}} days, {{name:person1}}'s family had no information about their whereabouts. Phone calls to authorities went unanswered. On day {{number:first-contact-day}}, they finally received a brief call confirming {{name:person1}} was alive but providing no other details.

  {{name:person1}}'s family scraped together {{currency:bail-amount}} for bail. This amount represented approximately {{number:months-salary}} months of {{name:parent}}'s salary as a {{occupation:parent-job}}.

  After {{number:detention-days}} days in custody, {{name:person1}} was released with strict conditions: no social media, no attending gatherings, and regular check-ins with authorities. The charges remain pending.

  "I just wanted to light a candle for Mahsa," {{name:person1}} said. "I never imagined this would happen."
