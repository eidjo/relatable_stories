content: >-
  {{name:student}}, a {{number:age}}-year-old university student from {{place:hometown}}, was interested in art and music. She kept an online journal where she wrote about breathing, continuing, and tomorrow. She recorded names of detained friends and classmates, understanding that repression begins with erasure.

  On the morning of {{date:protest-date}}, protests erupted across Iran. Within hours, demonstrations spread to more than {{number:cities}} cities and towns. {{name:student}} joined protesters near {{place:square}} in {{place:capital}}.

  The protests were met with overwhelming force. Security forces, including IRGC units and plainclothes agents, opened fire on crowds. According to classified documents{{source:death-toll}}, more than {{number:killed}} people were killed over two days, making it the deadliest protest massacre in history.

  {{name:student}} was shot near {{place:square}} on {{date:protest-date}}. She was {{number:age}} years old. Her family later found her body at {{place:morgue}}, one of thousands delivered to facilities overwhelmed by casualties.

  Medical staff reported that some wounded protesters were shot in the head while hospitalized{{source:hospital-executions}}. Images from morgues showed bodies with cardiac monitoring equipment still attached, suggesting patients under medical care were executed. Doctors and nurses described security forces entering hospitals and taking away wounded patients, some of whom were later found dead.

  The government cut internet access nationwide for {{number:blackout-days}} days, preventing families from sharing information and making it nearly impossible to document the scale of the killings. Bereaved families were forced to pay fees described as "bullet costs" to receive bodies. In some cases, authorities buried victims without family consent.

  {{name:student}} left behind no manifesto. What remains are fragments - short reflections carefully chosen. Her writing returned again and again to elemental concerns: breathing, continuing, tomorrow. She understood that being alive is not negotiable.

  Before she died, {{name:student}} wrote names. She named detainees and the missing. She recorded people as people, not as abstractions. She knew how repression begins - not with bullets, but with erasure.
