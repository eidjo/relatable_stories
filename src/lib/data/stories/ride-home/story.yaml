  I was coming back from a demonstration. I moved abroad a few years ago but I already made a few friends that I took with me. On the metro home, I sat down next to a middle-aged man. I noticed his small piece of paper glued onto cardboard; he noticed mine. That was enough to start a conversation.

  He had been driving alone for {{drive-time-demo}} hours to come to this demonstration. The day before, he had driven {{drive-time-previous}} hours back and forth to another one, even though he was clearly down with the flu. "That's the only thing I can do," he said. "People are dying on the streets. I am ashamed of being alive."

  I couldn't agree more how helpless I feel. How pointless all of my efforts have been. I fought my whole life: with patriarchy, then with my school staff, then university, after that municipality, and police. I ran away the fastest when morality police was following me. And I ran away even faster to exile, just to survive.

  I ran away from the biggest, and probably the only source of my life's traumas: of being jailed for "inappropriate" hijab in {{vozara-station}} in {{tehran}}; of being banned from continuing my education at the {{university}} because of political activities; of my dad being disappeared for {{dad-disappeared-months}} months before being found in {{zanjan-prison}}, just because of a measure he took in his job and it harmed a mollah's business.

  I left my life behind, and I pretended that I have a new one. But my traumas didn't leave me alone, neither did the government. So many people protested and around {{injured}} were injured one way or another, while I helplessly shouted in the streets of carefree cities, thousands of kilometres away from home.

  I remember {{years-since-threats}} years ago, when I couldn't stop speaking about the systematic massacre of Iranians, I received two distinct death threats. One day I woke up to find a comment plastered under all my posts on Instagram. It said, "If you ever show up here, we will fuck you and your sister to death." The message was clear: I could never return to my country again.

  It has been a long time since I smelled orange blossom in the air of my city, {{shiraz}}. I miss its warm sunshine and my parents' house, which I haven't seen for {{years-since-home}} years.

  And today, after {{killed}} people have been massacred {{killed:comparable}}, I don't even know why I deserved to go through all of this. I don't even know why I'm alive.
